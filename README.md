# BOAT: Bilateral Local Attention Vision Transformer


This is an unofficial implementation of the paper BOAT: Bilateral Local Attention Vision Transformer. 
The [Swin variant](https://github.com/mahaoyuHKU/pytorch-boat/tree/main/Swin) is based on [Swin Transformer](https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer)
The [CSwin variant](https://github.com/mahaoyuHKU/pytorch-boat/tree/main/CSwin) is based on [CSwin Tranformer](https://github.com/microsoft/CSWin-Transformer)
Please check corresponding folders for more installation instructions.
